## Use Cases

### Automated Onboarding

Streamline new employee device setup:

1. Employee starts in HRIS (BambooHR, Workday)
2. Harmony triggers device enrollment
3. Device is automatically categorized by department
4. Compliance policies applied based on role
5. Required apps deployed automatically
6. User receives setup instructions via Slack/Teams

### Compliance Remediation

Automate resolution of compliance issues:

```
Scenario: Device falls out of compliance
1. Harmony detects non-compliant device
2. Identifies issue (e.g., outdated OS)
3. Notifies user via Slack
4. Guides user through update process
5. Verifies compliance after remediation
6. Documents resolution
```

### Device Troubleshooting

AI-powered endpoint support:

- User reports slow device performance
- Harmony queries Intune for device health
- Identifies issues (low storage, resource-heavy apps)
- Recommends and executes remediation steps
- Follows up to verify resolution
- Updates knowledge base with solution

### Offboarding Automation

Secure device management during employee exits:

1. Employee offboarding initiated in HRIS
2. Harmony retrieves device list from Intune
3. Executes remote lock on corporate devices
4. Initiates data wipe after confirmation
5. Removes device from management
6. Updates asset tracking systems
7. Documents offboarding completion

## Troubleshooting

### Devices Not Syncing

**Issue**: Device inventory not updating in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API permissions include DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All
- Check that admin consent was granted
- Ensure client secret hasn't expired
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Verify devices are actually enrolled in Intune

### Remote Actions Failing

**Issue**: Unable to execute remote commands on devices

**Solutions**:
- Confirm ReadWrite permissions are granted (not just Read)
- Verify device is online and connected to Intune
- Check that device hasn't reached action limit
- Ensure device supports the requested action
- Review Intune service health in Microsoft 365 admin center

### Compliance Status Delays

**Issue**: Compliance status not updating in real-time

**Solutions**:
- Intune devices check in periodically (every 8 hours by default)
- Force device to sync with Intune from device or portal
- Adjust sync frequency in Harmony settings
- Check device network connectivity
- Verify compliance policy is correctly configured

### App Deployment Issues

**Issue**: Apps not deploying to devices

**Solutions**:
- Verify app is properly configured in Intune
- Check that deployment is targeted to correct groups
- Ensure device meets app requirements
- Review app deployment status in Intune portal
- Check device has sufficient storage for app

## Best Practices

### Device Management

- **Categorization**: Use device categories for organized management
- **Dynamic Groups**: Leverage Azure AD dynamic groups for automatic assignment
- **Naming Conventions**: Standardize device naming for easy identification
- **Regular Audits**: Review device inventory quarterly
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automate device retirement for termed employees

### Compliance and Security

- **Layered Policies**: Create baseline and role-specific compliance policies
- **Grace Periods**: Allow reasonable time for compliance remediation
- **Conditional Access**: Combine Intune compliance with Azure AD Conditional Access
- **Regular Updates**: Keep policies current with security best practices
- **User Communication**: Notify users before enforcing new policies

### Performance Optimization

- **Selective Sync**: Only sync devices that require active management
- **Batch Operations**: Schedule bulk changes during off-hours
- **Efficient Polling**: Use webhooks where possible instead of polling
- **Group-Based Management**: Manage devices via groups rather than individually
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed device data

### Automation Strategy

- **Start Small**: Begin with simple automation rules and expand gradually
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test automation on pilot groups before full deployment
- **Monitor Closely**: Track automation success rates and adjust rules
- **Human Escalation**: Always provide path to human intervention
- **Documentation**: Document automation rules and their purposes

## Data & Privacy

### Data Handling

- Device data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)
- Harmony caches device metadata; full data remains in Microsoft 365
- Personal device data on BYOD devices handled according to privacy policies
- Data retention follows your configured policies
- Device information is processed according to GDPR requirements

### Compliance

- **GDPR**: Full compliance with EU data protection regulations
- **HIPAA**: Available for healthcare organizations (BAA required)
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Both Intune and Harmony maintain certification
- **Microsoft 365 Compliance**: Inherits Microsoft's compliance framework
- **Audit Trails**: All actions logged for compliance reporting
