## Use Cases

### Unified User Provisioning

Centralized user management across all platforms:

1. New employee added to JumpCloud
2. Harmony detects new user in "Engineering" group
3. Automatically provisions:
   - Google Workspace account
   - GitHub organization access
   - Slack workspace membership
   - Okta secondary directory sync
   - VPN access
4. Assigns to appropriate teams and security groups
5. Sends personalized onboarding guide
6. Tracks provisioning completion

### Self-Service Access Requests

Streamlined application access via Harmony:

```
User via Slack: "I need access to Figma"
Harmony:
1. Checks JumpCloud for existing Figma access
2. Verifies user's role and permissions
3. Routes approval to manager if required
4. Adds user to Figma SSO app in JumpCloud
5. Confirms: "✅ You now have access to Figma. Sign in at figma.com"
6. Logs access grant for audit
```

### Password Reset Automation

AI-powered password assistance:

- User: "I forgot my password"
- Harmony:
  1. Verifies user identity
  2. Triggers password reset in JumpCloud
  3. Sends reset email to user
  4. Provides guidance on creating strong password
  5. Confirms when reset is complete
  6. Offers MFA enrollment if not enabled

### Cross-Platform Access Management

Maintain consistent access across environments:

- User role changes from "Developer" to "Senior Developer"
- Harmony updates JumpCloud user group
- JumpCloud propagates access changes to:
  - Windows domain (via LDAP)
  - macOS devices (via JumpCloud agent)
  - Linux servers (via RADIUS/LDAP)
  - SSO applications (via SAML)
- All access levels automatically adjusted

### MFA Compliance Monitoring

Ensure security policy adherence:

1. Harmony scans JumpCloud users for MFA status
2. Identifies users without MFA enrolled
3. Sends reminder via Slack: "Please enroll in MFA for account security"
4. Provides enrollment instructions and support link
5. Tracks enrollment completion
6. Escalates to security team if not enrolled within deadline
7. Generates compliance report for management

## Troubleshooting

### Users Not Syncing

**Issue**: New users in JumpCloud don't appear in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API key has User Management read permissions
- Check user status filter settings (active vs. suspended)
- Ensure users have required attributes (email, username)
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Review JumpCloud audit logs for API access

### SSO Application Access Not Granted

**Issue**: Cannot add users to SSO applications

**Solutions**:
- Confirm API key has SSO Application write permissions
- Verify application exists and is active in JumpCloud
- Check that user account is active (not suspended)
- Ensure application supports API-based user assignment
- Review JumpCloud logs for specific error messages

### Group Membership Changes Not Syncing

**Issue**: Group updates don't reflect in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API key has Group Management permissions
- Check sync frequency settings
- Trigger manual sync to refresh data
- Ensure groups are properly configured in JumpCloud
- Review group sync filters in Harmony settings

### Authentication Failures

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key" errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify API key copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check that API key hasn't been revoked in JumpCloud
- Ensure organization ID is correct
- Confirm API endpoint URL is accurate
- Regenerate API key if necessary

## Best Practices

### User Management

- **Consistent Naming**: Use standard username formats (firstname.lastname)
- **Complete Profiles**: Ensure all required attributes populated
- **Group Organization**: Use hierarchical groups for clarity
- **Regular Audits**: Review user accounts and access quarterly
- **Deactivation Process**: Promptly suspend departing users

### Security and Compliance

- **MFA Enforcement**: Require MFA for all users
- **Password Policies**: Implement strong password requirements
- **Access Reviews**: Conduct regular access certification
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Monitor and review authentication logs

### Integration Maintenance

- **API Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys annually
- **Permission Reviews**: Audit API permissions quarterly
- **Sync Monitoring**: Track sync success rates and errors
- **Performance Optimization**: Use appropriate sync frequencies
- **Documentation**: Maintain current integration documentation

### Automation Strategy

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic user provisioning
