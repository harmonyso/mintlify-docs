## Use Cases

### Automated Developer Onboarding

Seamless access provisioning for new engineers:

1. New developer hired (recorded in BambooHR/Workday)
2. Harmony detects new engineering employee
3. Sends GitHub organization invitation automatically
4. Adds to teams based on role (Backend Team, Mobile Team, etc.)
5. Grants repository access according to permissions matrix
6. Sends welcome message with getting started guide
7. Tracks onboarding completion

### Self-Service Repository Access

Empower developers with instant access:

```
Developer via Slack: "I need access to the api-gateway repository"
Harmony:
1. Checks if api-gateway exists
2. Verifies user's role and permissions
3. Confirms access is appropriate for role
4. Grants write access to repository
5. Responds: "✅ You now have write access to api-gateway"
6. Logs access grant for audit
```

### License Optimization

Reduce GitHub seat costs:

- Harmony tracks last active date for all users
- Identifies users inactive for 90+ days
- Alerts IT team with inactive user list
- Recommends converting to outside collaborators
- Projects potential cost savings
- Automates seat reclamation with approval

### Secure Offboarding

Ensure access removal during employee exits:

1. Employee offboarding initiated in HRIS
2. Harmony retrieves all GitHub access
3. Generates report of repositories and teams
4. Checks for any repositories owned by user
5. Archives or transfers repository ownership
6. Removes from all teams and repositories
7. Removes from organization
8. Documents complete access removal
9. Notifies manager of completion

### Repository Creation

Standardized repository setup:

- Developer: "Create a new microservice repo called user-service"
- Harmony:
  1. Validates naming convention
  2. Creates repository from template
  3. Sets up branch protection rules
  4. Adds to appropriate teams
  5. Configures CI/CD integration
  6. Sends setup guide to developer

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to Add Members

**Issue**: Cannot add users to GitHub organization

**Solutions**:
- Verify GitHub App has "Members: Write" organization permission
- Check organization membership limits on plan
- Ensure user has GitHub account with correct email
- Verify SSO/SAML requirements (Enterprise Cloud)
- Check that organization hasn't reached maximum seats

### Team Sync Failures

**Issue**: Team memberships not syncing correctly

**Solutions**:
- Confirm "Members: Write" permission is granted
- Verify team slug/name is correct
- Check that user is member of organization first
- Ensure team permissions allow additions
- Review GitHub audit log for errors

### Repository Access Not Granting

**Issue**: Users don't receive repository access

**Solutions**:
- Verify "Administration: Write" repository permission
- Check that repository exists and is accessible
- Ensure user is organization member
- Verify not blocked by branch protection or security rules
- Review repository settings for access restrictions

### Webhook Events Not Received

**Issue**: Real-time updates not working

**Solutions**:
- Verify webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check webhook secret matches configuration
- Review webhook delivery logs in GitHub App settings
- Ensure webhook events are subscribed
- Test webhook with manual delivery

## Best Practices

### Access Management

- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access by default
- **Team-Based Access**: Use teams for permissions, not individual grants
- **Regular Audits**: Review repository access quarterly
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Provide time-limited access for sensitive repos
- **Separation of Duties**: Separate read/write/admin access appropriately

### Onboarding Efficiency

- **Automation First**: Automate standard access provisioning
- **Role-Based Templates**: Define access templates by job role
- **Progressive Access**: Start with minimal access, increase as needed
- **Documentation**: Provide clear onboarding guides
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect developer feedback on onboarding experience

### Security and Compliance

- **Offboarding Verification**: Always verify complete access removal
- **Repository Ownership**: Ensure all repos have active owners
- **Access Logging**: Maintain audit trail of all access changes
- **Sensitive Repos**: Require additional approval for sensitive repositories
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct access reviews with engineering managers

### License Management

- **Usage Monitoring**: Track seat utilization monthly
- **Inactive User Cleanup**: Remove inactive users regularly
- **Outside Collaborators**: Use for external/limited access needs
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-size license tiers based on usage
- **Forecast Planning**: Project seat needs for hiring plans
