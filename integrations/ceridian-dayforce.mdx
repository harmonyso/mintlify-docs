## Use Cases

### Automated Pre-Boarding

Start IT provisioning before day one:

1. HR adds new employee to Dayforce (start date: 2 weeks from now)
2. Harmony detects new employee in "Pending" status
3. Two weeks before start:
   - Orders laptop and peripherals
   - Creates email account (disabled until start date)
   - Prepares account credentials
4. One week before:
   - Ships laptop to employee's address
   - Sends pre-boarding email with company info
5. Day before start:
   - Enables email account
   - Sends setup instructions
6. On start date:
   - Activates all accounts
   - Sends welcome Slack message
   - Creates onboarding checklist

### Payroll-Driven Access

Use payroll events to control access:

```
Scenario: Contractor Conversion to Employee
1. HR changes employee type from "Contractor" to "Full-Time"
2. Payroll status updated in Dayforce
3. Harmony detects employment type change
4. Automatically:
   - Upgrades to full employee licenses (Microsoft 365 E3)
   - Grants access to employee-only systems (401k portal)
   - Adds to full-time security groups
   - Sends benefits enrollment information
5. Notifies employee of new access and benefits
```

### Leave of Absence Management

Temporary access management:

- Employee goes on maternity leave (3 months)
- Dayforce status changes to "LOA"
- Harmony:
  1. Suspends non-essential accounts (keep email active)
  2. Sets Slack status to "Out on leave - back [date]"
  3. Redirects IT tickets to backup team member
  4. Removes from on-call rotations
  5. Retains access for secure email checks
- Before return date:
  6. Re-enables all accounts
  7. Sends "welcome back" message
  8. Updates manager on account status

### Department Reorganization

Automated access adjustment during reorgs:

1. HR reorganizes departments in Dayforce
2. 50 employees move from "IT-Operations" to "Engineering-Platform"
3. Harmony detects department changes
4. For each employee:
   - Updates Slack channels
   - Adjusts GitHub team memberships
   - Modifies AWS IAM groups
   - Updates email distribution lists
   - Changes approval workflows
5. Notifies managers of completed changes
6. Generates reorganization report

### Secure Offboarding

Complete termination workflow:

1. HR terminates employee in Dayforce (last day: Friday 5 PM)
2. Harmony creates offboarding plan:
   - Asset retrieval (laptop, phone, badge)
   - Account deactivation schedule
   - Data transfer requirements
3. On termination date at 5 PM:
   - Disables all accounts immediately
   - Removes VPN/network access
   - Removes from all distribution lists
   - Locks physical access badge
4. Within 24 hours:
   - Archives email to manager
   - Transfers files and documents
   - Cancels software licenses
5. Generates complete offboarding report

## Troubleshooting

### Employees Not Syncing

**Issue**: New employees in Dayforce don't appear in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify OAuth client has Employee Data read permissions
- Check employment status filter includes "Active" or "Pending"
- Ensure employees have required fields (email, employee number)
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Review Dayforce API logs for authentication issues

### OAuth Authentication Failures

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid credentials" errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Check that service account credentials are valid
- Ensure OAuth client hasn't been deactivated in Dayforce

### Department Mapping Issues

**Issue**: Employees assigned to wrong Harmony teams

**Solutions**:
- Review department code mapping in Harmony settings
- Check for department name changes in Dayforce
