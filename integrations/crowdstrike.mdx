## Configuration in CrowdStrike

### Step 1: Create OAuth2 API Client

1. Log in to CrowdStrike Falcon console
2. Navigate to **Support** > **API Clients and Keys**
3. Click **Add new API Client**
4. Configure client:
   - **Client Name**: "Harmony Integration"
   - **Description**: "Integration with Harmony IT operations platform"
5. Select **API Scopes** (click "Show all scopes" for full list):
   - **Detections**: Read
   - **Devices**: Read + Write (for containment actions)
   - **Incidents**: Read + Write
   - **Hosts**: Read
   - **Prevention Policies**: Read
   - **Sensor Update Policies**: Read
   - **Real Time Response**: Read + Write (for advanced remediation)
6. Click **Add**
7. **Copy the Client ID, Client Secret, and Base URL** immediately

<Warning>
The Client Secret will only be shown once. Store it securely.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Configure Detection Policies

Ensure your detection policies are configured:

1. Go to **Configuration** > **Prevention Policies**
2. Review or create policies for different device groups
3. Set detection and prevention levels appropriately
4. Document policy names for Harmony mapping

### Step 3: Set Up Host Groups (Optional)

Organize devices for better management:

1. Navigate to **Configuration** > **Host Management** > **Host Groups**
2. Create groups by department, location, or function
3. Assign policies to host groups
4. These groups will be synced to Harmony for routing

## Configuration in Harmony

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log in to your Harmony dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
3. Find **CrowdStrike** and click **Connect**

### Step 2: Enter API Credentials

Provide the following information:

- **Client ID**: Your OAuth2 client ID
- **Client Secret**: Your OAuth2 client secret
- **Base URL**: Your CrowdStrike cloud (e.g., `https://api.crowdstrike.com`)
- **Customer ID**: Your CrowdStrike Customer ID (CID)

Click **Verify Connection**

### Step 3: Configure Detection Settings

1. **Alert Severity Threshold**: Choose minimum severity for Harmony alerts (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
2. **Detection Types**: Select which detection types to monitor
3. **Auto-Containment**: Enable automatic device containment for Critical threats (optional)
4. **Ticket Creation**: Auto-create tickets for security incidents
5. **Notification Routing**: Route alerts to specific Slack channels or teams

### Step 4: Set Up Response Automation

Configure intelligent security workflows:

1. **Critical Threat Response**:
   - Trigger: Critical severity detection
   - Action: Contain device immediately
   - Notify: Alert security team via Slack
   - Escalate: Create high-priority ticket
2. **Malware Detection**:
   - Trigger: Malware detection on endpoint
   - Action: Quarantine file, scan system
   - Notify: Inform user and IT team
   - Document: Log incident with resolution steps
3. **Policy Violations**:
   - Trigger: Prevention policy violation
   - Action: Enforce policy, educate user
   - Monitor: Track repeat violations
4. Click **Save Configuration** and **Enable Integration**

## What Harmony Syncs

### From CrowdStrike to Harmony

- **Detections**: All security detections with severity and details
- **Incidents**: Security incidents and investigation data
- **Device Status**: Falcon agent status, version, and health
- **Host Information**: Device details, OS, network information
- **Containment State**: Whether devices are contained or released
- **Prevention Policies**: Applied policies and compliance status
- **Threat Intelligence**: IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and threat actors
- **Alerts**: Real-time security alerts and notifications
- **Remediation Actions**: Executed response actions and results

### From Harmony to CrowdStrike

## Use Cases

### Automated Threat Response

Immediate response to critical threats:

```
Scenario: Ransomware Detection
1. CrowdStrike detects ransomware on device
2. Harmony immediately contains the device
3. Sends critical alert to security team Slack channel
4. Notifies affected user: "Your device has been isolated for security"
5. Creates high-priority incident ticket
6. Initiates forensic data collection
7. Begins automated investigation workflow
```

### User-Friendly Security Notifications

Translate security alerts for end users:

- **Technical Alert**: "NGAV ML Detection: Suspicious PowerShell Activity"
- **Harmony to User**: "We detected potentially harmful activity on your computer and took action to protect you. The IT security team has been notified."

### Device Compliance Monitoring

Track endpoint protection status:

- Monitor Falcon agent health across all devices
- Alert when agents go offline or outdated
- Automatically resolve common agent issues
- Escalate persistent problems to IT team

### Incident Investigation

AI-assisted security investigations:

- User reports suspicious activity
- Harmony queries CrowdStrike for recent detections
- Retrieves timeline of security events
- Provides security analyst with comprehensive context
- Links related tickets and incidents
- Documents investigation findings

### Offboarding Security

Secure device management during employee exits:

1. Employee offboarding triggered in HRIS
2. Harmony checks CrowdStrike for assigned devices
3. Verifies no active security incidents
4. Documents device security status
5. After device retrieval, removes from monitoring
6. Maintains forensic data per retention policy

## Troubleshooting

### Detections Not Appearing

**Issue**: Security detections from CrowdStrike don't show in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API client has "Detections: Read" scope
- Check severity threshold settings in Harmony
- Ensure API credentials are valid and not expired
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Review CrowdStrike audit logs for API access

### Containment Actions Failing

**Issue**: Cannot contain devices via Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Confirm API client has "Devices: Write" scope
- Verify device is online and has active Falcon agent
- Check that device isn't already contained
- Ensure user has appropriate CrowdStrike permissions
- Review containment policy in CrowdStrike console

### Alerts Not Routing

**Issue**: Security alerts not appearing in Slack/Teams

**Solutions**:
- Verify notification routing configuration in Harmony
- Check Slack/Teams integration is active
- Review alert severity threshold settings
- Test with a sample detection
- Check notification channel permissions

### API Rate Limiting

**Issue**: Integration slows down or fails

**Solutions**:
- CrowdStrike API has rate limits (varies by license)
- Implement smart polling intervals
- Use webhook delivery if available
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Contact CrowdStrike to discuss rate limit increases

## Best Practices

### Security Operations

- **Tiered Response**: Define different response actions for each severity level
- **Escalation Paths**: Clear paths from automated to human response
- **Playbooks**: Document response playbooks for common scenarios
- **Regular Drills**: Test automated response workflows quarterly
- **Continuous Tuning**: Adjust detection thresholds based on false positive rates

### Alert Management

- **Noise Reduction**: Filter low-severity alerts that don't require action
- **Context Enhancement**: Enrich alerts with user and device context
- **Smart Routing**: Route alerts to appropriate teams based on type
- **SLA Tracking**: Monitor time to detection, containment, and resolution
- **After-Action Reviews**: Learn from incidents to improve automation

### User Communication

- **Non-Technical Language**: Translate security jargon for end users
- **Clear Actions**: Tell users exactly what to do (or not do)
- **Timely Updates**: Keep users informed during incidents
- **Education**: Use incidents as teaching moments
- **Transparency**: Be honest about what happened and why

### Integration Maintenance

- **Credential Rotation**: Rotate API credentials regularly
- **Permission Reviews**: Audit API client permissions quarterly
- **Update Monitoring**: Track CrowdStrike API changes
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor integration health and performance
- **Documentation**: Keep integration documentation current

## Data & Privacy
