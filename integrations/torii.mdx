## Use Cases

### Automated License Lifecycle

End-to-end license management:

1. **Hire**: New employee (Marketing Manager)
2. **Check**: Torii for available licenses
3. **Provision**: Assign licenses:
   - Slack Enterprise ($8/mo)
   - HubSpot Professional ($50/mo)
   - Canva Pro ($13/mo)
   - Zoom ($15/mo)
4. **Track**: Monitor usage after 30 days
5. **Optimize**: Revoke Canva if unused
6. **Terminate**: Reclaim all licenses on exit

### Cost Optimization

Identify and eliminate waste:

```
Scenario: Quarterly License Review
1. Torii identifies 15 inactive Figma licenses
2. Harmony notifies license owners:
   "Your Figma license hasn't been used in 60 days"
3. Owners respond:
   - 8 users: "Don't need it anymore"
   - 5 users: "Still need it"
   - 2 users: No response (auto-revoked after 7 days)
4. Licenses revoked: 10 total
5. Monthly savings: $150 (10 × $15/mo)
6. Annual savings: $1,800
7. Reallocate licenses to waitlist requests
```

### Shadow IT Governance

Manage unsanctioned application usage:

- Torii discovers employee using Dropbox (not approved)
- Harmony creates security review ticket
- Security team assesses:
  - Risk level: Medium
  - Business justification: Valid
  - Official alternative: Google Drive
- Harmony notifies employee:
  - Explains security policy
  - Offers Google Drive as alternative
  - Provides migration assistance
- If accepted: Provisions Google Drive, blocks Dropbox
- If declined: Escalates to manager for decision
- Documents outcome in compliance records

### Just-in-Time Provisioning

On-demand access with automated cleanup:

- Developer: "I need temporary Datadog access for 2 weeks"
- Harmony checks Torii for available license
- Assigns Datadog license with 14-day expiration
- Sends access credentials
- After 14 days:
  - Automatically revokes access
  - Returns license to pool
  - Notifies user of expiration
- Developer can request extension if needed

### New Starter License Optimization

Role-based intelligent provisioning:

1. New hire: Software Engineer
2. Harmony consults Torii for standard engineer apps
3. Analyzes usage patterns of similar engineers
4. Provisions core tools immediately:
   - GitHub (100% of engineers use)
   - Slack (100% use)
   - Zoom (100% use)
5. Defers optional tools:
   - Figma (40% use) - Provision on request
   - Postman (60% use) - Provision on request
6. Saves $50/month by not over-provisioning
7. Provides self-service catalog for additional tools
