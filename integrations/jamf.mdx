## Prerequisites

Before connecting Jamf to Harmony, ensure you have:

1. **Jamf Pro Administrator access**
2. **Permissions to create API users and roles**
3. **Your Jamf Pro URL** (e.g., `company.jamfcloud.com`)
4. **A Harmony account** with admin privileges

<Note>
  Jamf Pro (not Jamf Now) is required for full API access and automation capabilities.
</Note>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    1. Click **Connect**
    2. Harmony will authenticate and fetch device inventory
    3. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message

## What Harmony Syncs from Jamf

Once connected, Harmony automatically syncs:

### Computers (macOS Devices)

- Device hardware information (model, serial, specs)
- Operating system version and build
- User assignments
- Last check-in and inventory dates
- Installed applications
- Security settings (FileVault, firewall, etc.)
- Smart/Static group memberships
- Configuration profile status

### Mobile Devices (iOS/iPadOS)

- Device model and identifier
- iOS/iPadOS version
- Supervised status
- Assigned user
- Last inventory update
- Installed apps
- Compliance status
- Enrollment method

### Policies and Profiles

- Configuration profile list
- Policy names and scopes
- Deployment status
- Success/failure rates

### Users

- User accounts and details
- Device assignments
- Group memberships

<Tip>
  Harmony syncs inventory data every 6 hours by default. Device check-ins trigger real-time updates for critical changes.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

### Automated Device Onboarding

Streamline new device setup for employees:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-Enrollment">
    When new device is ordered:
    - Auto-assign to correct smart group
    - Stage configuration profiles
    - Prepare app deployment policies
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enrollment Workflow">
    When device enrolls in Jamf:
    - Trigger Harmony workflow
    - Apply department-specific configuration
    - Install required applications
    - Set up security policies (FileVault, firewall)
    - Assign to employee record
    - Create ticket for physical delivery
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post-Enrollment">
    - Verify all policies applied successfully
    - Notify IT of any failures
    - Send welcome email to employee
    - Schedule first-day check-in
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Compliance Monitoring

Ensure all devices meet security requirements:

- **Policy Violations**: Alert when devices don't comply
- **Out-of-Date OS**: Flag devices running old macOS/iOS versions
- **Missing Encryption**: Identify unencrypted devices
- **Unauthorized Apps**: Detect prohibited applications
- **Automatic Remediation**: Trigger policy re-deployment

### Device Lifecycle Management

- **New Device**: Automated enrollment and configuration
- **Employee Transfer**: Re-assign device, apply new policies
- **Device Upgrade**: Backup, wipe, re-enroll
- **Retirement**: Offboard, wipe, remove from inventory

### Proactive Support

Detect and resolve issues before users report them:

- Monitor disk space and alert when low
- Track battery health and replacement needs
- Identify devices with repeated policy failures
- Detect connectivity issues
- Create tickets automatically for intervention

## Troubleshooting

### Connection fails with authentication error

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect Client ID or Secret
- API client has been disabled
- Jamf Pro URL incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Client ID and Secret were copied correctly
2. Check API client status in Jamf Pro
3. Confirm Jamf Pro URL includes `https://` and is accessible
4. Regenerate credentials if unsure

### Device inventory not syncing

**Possible causes:**
- Missing read permissions for computers/mobile devices
- Devices haven't checked in recently
- API rate limits reached

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API client has inventory read privileges
2. Check device last check-in dates in Jamf Pro
3. For large fleets (5,000+ devices), contact support for optimization

### Cannot deploy policies or profiles

**Possible causes:**
- Missing write permissions
- Target scope not defined
- Profile conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure API client has policy/profile management privileges
2. Verify smart group or static group scope is set
3. Check for conflicting profiles in Jamf Pro

### Webhooks not triggering workflows

**Possible causes:**
- Webhooks not configured in Jamf Pro
- Network firewall blocking requests
- Workflow trigger conditions not met

**Solutions:**
1. Configure webhooks in Jamf Pro pointing to Harmony
2. Whitelist Harmony webhook URLs in firewall
3. Review workflow trigger conditions

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
  **API Client Permissions**: Grant only the minimum privileges required for your use case. Avoid giving full administrative access unless absolutely necessary.
</Warning>

**Security best practices:**

- Rotate API credentials every 90 days
- Use IP restrictions if Jamf Pro supports it
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Enable audit logging for all API actions
- Store credentials in Harmony's encrypted vault
- Review privileges quarterly
