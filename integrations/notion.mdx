## Prerequisites

Before configuring the Notion integration, ensure you have:

- **Notion Workspace Admin**: Ability to create and manage integrations
- **Notion API Access**: Workspace with API access enabled
- **Harmony Account**: Active Harmony workspace with integration permissions

## Configuration in Notion

### Step 1: Create Internal Integration

1. Go to [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **+ New integration**
3. Configure integration settings:
   - **Name**: "Harmony AI"
   - **Associated workspace**: Select your workspace
   - **Logo**: Upload Harmony logo (optional)
4. Under **Capabilities**, select:
   - ☑️ Read content
   - ☑️ Update content (if you want Harmony to update pages)
   - ☑️ Insert content (if you want Harmony to create pages)
5. Click **Submit**
6. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** (starts with `secret_`)

### Step 2: Share Pages with Integration

The integration needs explicit access to pages:

1. Open the Notion page or database you want to share
2. Click **Share** in the top right
3. Click **Invite**
4. Search for your integration name ("Harmony AI")
5. Select the integration and click **Invite**
6. Repeat for all pages/databases Harmony should access

<Note>
For full workspace access, share your root workspace page. All child pages will be accessible.
</Note>

### Step 3: Organize Content for AI Access

Structure your Notion workspace for optimal AI retrieval:

1. **IT Documentation**: Create a dedicated section for IT runbooks
2. **FAQs**: Maintain a database of frequently asked questions
3. **Asset Information**: Keep hardware and software inventory in databases
4. **Policies**: Store IT policies and procedures
5. **Troubleshooting Guides**: Maintain step-by-step resolution guides

## Configuration in Harmony

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log in to your Harmony dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
3. Find **Notion** and click **Connect**

### Step 2: Enter Integration Token

1. Paste the **Internal Integration Token** from Notion
2. Click **Verify Connection**
3. Harmony will discover all accessible pages and databases

### Step 3: Configure Knowledge Base Settings

1. **Select Searchable Pages**: Choose which pages should be searchable by AI
2. **Priority Levels**: Set priority for different content types (e.g., prioritize runbooks over meeting notes)
3. **Update Permissions**: Enable if Harmony should update pages with new solutions
4. **Sync Frequency**: Choose how often to sync content (real-time, hourly, daily)
5. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 4: Set Up Content Templates (Optional)

Create templates for Harmony to use when creating new documentation:

1. **Incident Resolution Template**: For documenting resolved incidents
2. **Runbook Template**: For new troubleshooting procedures
3. **FAQ Template**: For frequently asked questions
4. Click **Enable Integration**

## What Harmony Syncs

### From Notion to Harmony

- **Page Content**: All text, headings, and formatted content from shared pages
- **Page Titles**: Page and section titles for indexing
- **Databases**: Database schemas, properties, and records
- **Page Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships between pages
- **Last Updated**: Modification timestamps for freshness tracking
- **Page URLs**: Deep links to specific pages
- **Mentions**: User mentions and page references
- **Embeds**: Embedded content (limited support)

### From Harmony to Notion

- **New Documentation**: Pages created for new runbooks or procedures
- **Resolution Notes**: Updates to existing troubleshooting guides
- **FAQ Entries**: New frequently asked questions
- **Statistics**: Usage metrics for documentation effectiveness
- **Comments**: AI-generated suggestions for content improvements
- **Links**: Cross-references to related tickets or documentation

## Use Cases

### Intelligent Support Responses

Use Notion as your AI's knowledge base:

```
User: "How do I reset my VPN password?"
Harmony AI:
1. Searches Notion for "VPN password reset"
2. Finds relevant runbook page
3. Provides step-by-step instructions
4. Includes link to full documentation
```

### Automated Documentation

Keep documentation current with resolved tickets:

- When Harmony resolves a new issue type, it creates a Notion page
- Updates existing runbooks when procedures change
- Tracks which documentation is most frequently accessed
- Suggests consolidation of duplicate content

### Self-Service Knowledge Portal

Empower users with instant access to information:

- Harmony surfaces relevant Notion pages during conversations
- Users can browse documentation without leaving Slack/Teams
- AI summarizes long documentation into actionable steps
- Tracks which articles help resolve issues most effectively

### Asset Management

Use Notion databases for IT asset tracking:

- Query Notion databases for hardware/software information
- Update asset status when tickets are resolved
- Track license assignments and renewal dates
- Generate reports from Notion database data

## Troubleshooting

### Harmony Can't Find Pages

**Issue**: AI doesn't retrieve expected Notion content

**Solutions**:
- Verify pages are shared with the Harmony integration
- Check that integration token has required permissions
- Ensure pages aren't in archived sections
- Re-sync content in Harmony settings

### Outdated Content

**Issue**: AI provides information from old documentation

**Solutions**:
- Increase sync frequency in Harmony settings
- Manually trigger a sync from Harmony dashboard
- Check Notion page "Last edited" timestamps
- Enable real-time sync for critical documentation

### Integration Token Expired

**Issue**: Connection to Notion fails

**Solutions**:
- Notion integration tokens don't expire, but workspace changes can affect them
- Verify integration still exists in Notion integrations page
- Check that workspace admin hasn't revoked access
- Regenerate token and update in Harmony if necessary

### Permission Errors

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" or "Forbidden" errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify integration capabilities include required permissions
- Ensure pages are explicitly shared with integration
- Check that user who created integration still has workspace access
- Re-share pages with integration if permissions changed

## Best Practices

### Content Organization

- **Dedicated IT Section**: Keep IT documentation in a specific section
- **Consistent Structure**: Use templates for consistent page formatting
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive titles that AI can understand
- **Tags and Properties**: Use database properties to categorize content
- **Regular Reviews**: Audit and update documentation quarterly

### Performance Optimization

- **Selective Sharing**: Only share pages relevant to IT support
- **Database Limits**: Large databases may impact sync performance
- **Embed Minimization**: Minimize embeds and integrations that slow loading
- **Archive Old Content**: Move outdated pages to archive section
- **Index Optimization**: Use clear headings and structure for better AI retrieval

### Security and Privacy

- **Sensitive Data**: Don't store credentials or secrets in shared pages
- **Access Review**: Regularly review which pages are shared with integration
- **User Training**: Educate team on what content is accessible to AI
- **Data Classification**: Mark sensitive pages and exclude from integration

### Documentation Quality

- **Actionable Content**: Write step-by-step procedures, not just descriptions
- **Regular Updates**: Keep documentation current with system changes
- **User Feedback**: Track which articles are most helpful
- **Continuous Improvement**: Update based on AI usage patterns
- **Version History**: Use Notion's version history for tracking changes

## Data & Privacy

### Data Handling

- Harmony indexes Notion content for search but doesn't store full copies
- Page content is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Search indexes are encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- Content is re-synced based on configured frequency
- Notion content remains under your control in your workspace

### Compliance

- **GDPR**: Content processing complies with GDPR requirements
- **Data Residency**: Notion data stays in Notion; only indexes are stored
- **Access Logs**: All integration access is logged in Notion audit trail
- **Right to Erasure**: Unsharing pages removes them from Harmony's index

### Access Control

- Integration only accesses explicitly shared pages
- Notion's workspace permissions apply
- Integration can be revoked instantly from Notion settings
- Harmony respects Notion's page-level permissions
