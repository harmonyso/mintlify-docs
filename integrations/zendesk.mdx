## Prerequisites

Before configuring the Zendesk integration, ensure you have:

- **Zendesk Administrator Access**: Ability to create API tokens and manage integrations
- **Zendesk Plan**: Professional plan or higher (for API access)
- **Harmony Account**: Active Harmony workspace with integration permissions
- **API Token**: Generated from Zendesk Admin Center

## Configuration in Zendesk

### Step 1: Generate API Token

1. Navigate to **Admin Center** > **Apps and integrations** > **APIs** > **Zendesk API**
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. Under **Token Access**, enable token access if not already enabled
4. Click **Add API token**
5. Enter a description (e.g., "Harmony Integration")
6. Copy the generated token immediately (it won't be shown again)
7. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Configure Webhook (Optional)

For real-time ticket updates:

1. Go to **Admin Center** > **Apps and integrations** > **Webhooks**
2. Click **Create webhook**
3. Configure:
   - **Endpoint URL**: Provided by Harmony
   - **Request method**: POST
   - **Authentication**: Bearer token (provided by Harmony)
4. Add triggers for ticket events (created, updated, solved)
5. Click **Create webhook**

### Step 3: Set Up Custom Fields (Optional)

Create custom fields to track Harmony sync status:

1. Navigate to **Admin Center** > **Objects and rules** > **Tickets** > **Fields**
2. Click **Add field**
3. Create fields:
   - **Harmony Ticket ID**: Text field
   - **Harmony Status**: Dropdown with values (Synced, Pending, Resolved)
4. Click **Save**

## Configuration in Harmony

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log in to your Harmony dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
3. Find **Zendesk** and click **Connect**

### Step 2: Enter Credentials

Provide the following information:

- **Zendesk Subdomain**: Your Zendesk subdomain (e.g., `company.zendesk.com`)
- **Email Address**: Your Zendesk admin email
- **API Token**: The token generated in Step 1
- **Sync Direction**: Choose bidirectional, Zendesk → Harmony, or Harmony → Zendesk

### Step 3: Configure Sync Settings

1. **Ticket Status Mapping**: Map Zendesk statuses to Harmony statuses
2. **Priority Mapping**: Align priority levels between platforms
3. **User Assignment**: Configure how agents are mapped
4. **Custom Field Mapping**: Map custom fields between systems
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 4: Enable Automation Rules

Configure automation rules:

1. **Auto-Resolution**: Enable Harmony AI to automatically resolve certain ticket types
2. **Escalation Rules**: Set thresholds for human escalation
3. **Knowledge Base Integration**: Enable Zendesk Guide article search
4. Click **Enable Integration**

## What Harmony Syncs

### From Zendesk to Harmony

- **Tickets**: All ticket data including subject, description, status, priority
- **Comments**: Full conversation history and internal notes
- **Attachments**: Files attached to tickets
- **Users**: Requesters, agents, and administrators
- **Organizations**: Company/organization associations
- **Tags**: Ticket tags and labels
- **Custom Fields**: All configured custom field values
- **SLA Events**: SLA breach notifications and metrics

### From Harmony to Zendesk

- **Resolution Actions**: Automated resolution steps and outcomes
- **AI Responses**: Harmony-generated responses to ticket queries
- **Status Updates**: Real-time ticket status changes
- **Assignment Changes**: Ticket routing and agent assignments
- **Knowledge Articles**: Links to relevant documentation
- **Time Tracking**: Time spent on automated resolutions

## Use Cases

### Migrating from Zendesk to Harmony

Seamlessly transition from traditional ticketing to autonomous IT operations:

1. Enable bidirectional sync to maintain Zendesk records during transition
2. Gradually route tickets to Harmony for AI resolution
3. Monitor resolution rates and user satisfaction
4. Phase out Zendesk as confidence in Harmony grows

### Hybrid Support Model

Use both platforms for different support functions:

- **Zendesk**: Customer-facing support and external tickets
- **Harmony**: Internal IT support with autonomous resolution
- **Sync**: Keep both platforms updated for complete visibility

### Knowledge Base Enhancement

Leverage Zendesk Guide content in Harmony:

- Automatically search Zendesk articles when resolving tickets
- Surface relevant Help Center content to end users
- Track article effectiveness and suggest improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Tickets Not Syncing

**Issue**: Tickets created in Zendesk don't appear in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API token is valid and hasn't expired
- Check webhook configuration for real-time sync
- Review sync filters and ensure tickets meet criteria
- Confirm network connectivity between systems

### Duplicate Tickets

**Issue**: Same ticket appears multiple times in either system

**Solutions**:
- Check custom field mapping for unique identifiers
- Verify webhook triggers aren't duplicated
- Review sync direction settings
- Disable and re-enable integration if necessary

### Status Mapping Errors

**Issue**: Ticket statuses don't match between systems

**Solutions**:
- Review status mapping configuration
- Ensure all Zendesk statuses are mapped to Harmony equivalents
- Check for custom statuses that need manual mapping
- Test with a sample ticket to verify behavior

### API Rate Limiting

**Issue**: Integration slows down or fails intermittently

**Solutions**:
- Zendesk has API rate limits (200 requests per minute for Professional plan)
- Implement batch processing for bulk operations
- Contact Zendesk to increase rate limits if needed
- Use webhook-based sync to reduce API calls

## Best Practices

### Ticket Management

- **Status Consistency**: Maintain consistent status definitions across both platforms
- **Priority Alignment**: Ensure priority levels mean the same thing in both systems
- **SLA Preservation**: Configure SLAs in Harmony to match or exceed Zendesk SLAs
- **Tag Standardization**: Use consistent tagging across both platforms

### Performance Optimization

- **Selective Sync**: Only sync tickets that require dual visibility
- **Webhook Usage**: Use webhooks for real-time updates instead of polling
- **Batch Processing**: Process bulk operations during off-hours
- **Archive Strategy**: Archive old tickets to reduce sync overhead

### User Experience

- **Clear Communication**: Inform users about which platform to use for different request types
- **Consistent Branding**: Maintain consistent language and branding across both platforms
- **Training**: Provide training on when to use Zendesk vs. Harmony
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback on the hybrid experience

### Migration Strategy

- **Phased Approach**: Migrate ticket types gradually rather than all at once
- **Pilot Program**: Start with a small team or department
- **Success Metrics**: Define clear KPIs for migration success
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert if issues arise

## Data & Privacy

### Data Handling

- All ticket data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)
- Harmony stores minimal ticket metadata; full ticket content remains in Zendesk
- Personal information is processed according to GDPR and privacy regulations
- Data retention policies can be configured to match your compliance requirements

### Compliance

- **GDPR**: Full data subject rights support including access, deletion, and portability
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Both Zendesk and Harmony maintain SOC 2 certification
- **HIPAA**: Available for healthcare organizations (requires Business Associate Agreement)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment data is never stored; compliant with credit card handling requirements

### Access Control

- Harmony respects Zendesk's role-based access control
- API tokens can be scoped to specific permissions
- Audit logs track all integration activities
- Integration can be disabled instantly if security concerns arise
