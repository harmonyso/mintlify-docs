## Prerequisites

Before connecting Slack to Harmony, ensure you have:

1. **Slack Workspace Admin access** or permissions to install applications
2. **A Harmony account** with admin access to manage integrations
3. **At least one Slack channel** where you want Harmony to operate

<Note>
  Standard Slack workspace members can install apps, but your organization's app approval policy may require admin approval.
</Note>

***

## Connect Slack to Harmony

### Step 1: Initiate the Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    1. Log into your Harmony dashboard
    2. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**
    3. Find **Slack** under the **Collaboration** section
    4. Click **Connect** to begin the OAuth flow
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize in Slack">
    You'll be redirected to Slack's authorization page.

    **Important**: Ensure you have the correct Slack workspace selected in the top-right corner before proceeding.

    1. Review the requested permissions (see [Permissions](#permissions-explained) below)
    2. Select a channel to connect to Harmony initially
    3. Click **Allow** to authorize the connection

    At this point, Slack should be successfully connected to Harmony.
  </Step>
</Steps>

***

## Configure Slack as Your IT Help Desk

After connecting Slack, you'll land on the Slack configuration page in Harmony. The channel you selected during setup will be visible but in a **disabled state** by default—Harmony won't take any actions in the channel until you configure it.

### Configure Your Connected Channel

Once you've connected Slack, configure how Harmony should operate in the channel:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the Channel">
    1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Slack**
    2. Find your connected channel in the list
    3. Select a channel mode (see [Channel Modes](#channel-configuration-modes) below)
    4. Click **Save** to activate Harmony in the channel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    1. Go to your Slack channel
    2. Type a test message like "Help with password reset"
    3. Harmony should respond according to your selected channel mode
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connect Additional Channels

You can connect more channels in two ways:

**Method 1: Through OAuth flow**
1. Click **Add Channel** in the Slack integration settings
2. Select a different channel from the dropdown
3. Complete the authorization to add the new channel
4. Configure the mode for the new channel

**Method 2: Using @mention in Slack**
1. Go to any Slack channel where you want to add Harmony
2. Type `@Harmony` to mention the app
3. Click the **Add them** button when prompted
4. Configure the channel mode in Harmony settings

### Enable Direct Messaging (Optional)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure DM Support">
    1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Slack**
    2. Toggle on **Enable Direct Messages**
    3. Click **Save**

    Users can now DM Harmony directly for private IT support conversations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Recommended**: Start with **Silent Mode** to test the integration without notifying users. Once comfortable, switch to **Help Desk Mode** for full autonomous operation.
</Tip>

## Channel Configuration Modes

When you connect a Slack channel to Harmony, configure it to operate in different modes:

### Disabled Mode (Default)

*Harmony will do nothing*

- Harmony will not create tickets from messages
- Harmony will not respond to any messages in the channel
- Ideal for safely adding Harmony to a channel before activating features

### Silent Mode

*Harmony monitors the channel but operates quietly*

- Creates tickets based on messages in the channel
- Does not post responses or acknowledgments in the channel
- Tickets are created silently in the Harmony dashboard
- If you @mention Harmony, it will toggle on and attempt to help resolve the ticket
- Ideal for testing or when you want ticket creation without channel noise

### Help Desk Mode

*Full autonomous IT helpdesk functionality*

- Creates tickets from channel messages automatically
- Responds with intelligent AI-powered answers
- Attempts autonomous resolution using Harmony's AI and workflows
- Provides the complete autonomous support experience
- Recommended for primary IT support channels

### Team Only Mode

*Designed for internal IT team channels*

- IT team members can create tickets and request automation workflows
- Access to all available workflows, including secure team-only workflows
- Provides maximum functionality for internal IT operations
- Should only be used in channels restricted to IT team members

<Warning>
  Team Only Mode grants access to privileged workflows and sensitive IT operations. Only use in private channels with verified IT team members.
</Warning>

### Team Inbox Mode

*A dedicated channel for IT agents to triage all escalated tickets*

- Aggregates all escalated tickets into one channel for support agents
- Support agents can view, respond to, and collaborate on tickets
- Responses in threads sync automatically back to the end user's original location
- Egress-only: does not create new tickets from channel messages
- Should be a private channel with only IT support agents

<Info>
  Team Inbox is especially valuable when tickets come from DMs or other sources that support agents can't see directly.
</Info>

## Configure Team Inbox Channels

### What is a Team Inbox?

A private channel where IT support agents triage all escalated tickets within Slack. Every escalated ticket—from DMs, help desk channels, or the web—appears as a thread in this channel.

**Key benefits:**

- Triage all tickets in one centralized location
- Collaborate with other agents on ticket resolution
- Respond to end users directly from the inbox thread
- Never miss a ticket from DMs or private conversations

### Setting Up a Team Inbox

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a private Slack channel">
    Create a private channel in Slack for your IT support team's inbox (e.g., `#it-support-inbox`, `#helpdesk-triage`).

    <Tip>
      Use a clear naming convention like `#[team-name]-inbox`. Only add IT support staff—not end users—to this channel.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Harmony to the channel">
    In the channel, type `@Harmony` to mention the app and click **Add them** when prompted.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure as Team Inbox mode">
    1. In Harmony, navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Slack**
    2. Find the channel you just created
    3. Set the channel mode to **Team Inbox**
    4. Click **Save**

    All tickets for your team will now sync to this channel automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Working in Team Inbox Channels

Once configured, tickets automatically populate as threads:

1. **View**: Each ticket appears as a thread with details and history
2. **Respond**: Reply in the thread—your message sends to the end user automatically
3. **Manage**: Use commands like `@Harmony assign to me` to triage tickets

<Warning>
  Messages posted directly to the Team Inbox channel (not in ticket threads) will not create new tickets. Team Inbox mode is egress-only.
</Warning>

## Interacting with Harmony in Slack

Harmony provides multiple ways to interact directly from Slack:

### Slash Commands

Use `/harmony` from any channel or DM to create tickets instantly:

```
/harmony Password reset needed for john@company.com
```

### Message Actions

Convert any existing message into a ticket:

1. Hover over any message
2. Click the **⋯** (more actions) menu
3. Select **Create Harmony Ticket**

### @Mentions

Tag `@Harmony` in channels to activate assistance:

```
@Harmony How do I reset a user's MFA?
```

### Thread Replies

Continue natural conversations with context preservation—just reply in the thread where Harmony responded.

### Direct Messages

When enabled, users can DM Harmony for private support conversations.
