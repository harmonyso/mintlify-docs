## Prerequisites

Before connecting Google Workspace to Harmony, ensure you have:

1. **Google Workspace Super Admin access**
2. **A Harmony account** with admin privileges
3. **Domain ownership verified** in Google Workspace
4. **API access enabled** in Google Workspace admin console

<Note>
  You need Super Admin privileges to grant API access and configure OAuth consent for the integration.
</Note>

***

## Google Workspace Configuration

### Step 1: Enable API Access

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Admin Console">
    1. Sign in to the [Google Workspace Admin console](https://admin.google.com)
    2. Navigate to **Security → Access and data control → API controls**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable API Access">
    1. Ensure **Enable API access** is checked
    2. If not enabled, check the box and click **Save**

    <Warning>
      API access must be enabled for Harmony to connect to your Google Workspace environment.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Domain-Wide Delegation (Recommended)

For enhanced security and automation capabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Domain-Wide Delegation">
    1. In Admin console, go to **Security → Access and data control → API controls**
    2. Click **Manage Domain-Wide Delegation**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Harmony Client ID">
    1. Click **Add new**
    2. Enter the following Harmony Client ID: `harmony-workspace-integration`
    3. Add the following OAuth scopes:

    ```
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.orgunit
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.security
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.domain.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.licensing
    ```

    4. Click **Authorize**

    <Tip>
      Domain-wide delegation allows Harmony to act on behalf of your organization without requiring individual user consent.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Harmony Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrations">
    1. Log into your Harmony dashboard
    2. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**
    3. Find **Google Workspace** under **Identity & Access Management**
    4. Click **Connect**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize with Google">
    1. You'll be redirected to Google to authorize the connection
    2. Sign in with your Google Workspace Super Admin account
    3. Review the requested permissions
    4. Click **Allow** to authorize Harmony
    5. You'll be redirected back to Harmony
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    1. Confirm that Google Workspace shows **Connected** status
    2. User and group sync will begin automatically
    3. Initial sync may take several minutes depending on organization size
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Harmony Syncs from Google Workspace

Once connected, Harmony automatically syncs:

### Users

- User profiles (name, email, photo)
- User status (active, suspended, archived)
- Organizational units and departments
- Manager relationships
- Last login and creation dates
- License assignments
- 2-Step Verification status

### Groups

- Group names and descriptions
- Group members and managers
- Group settings and permissions
- Distribution lists

### Organizational Units

- OU hierarchy and structure
- OU members
- Inherited policies

### Licenses

- License SKUs and plans
- Assigned vs. available seats
- License costs and utilization
- User license assignments

<Tip>
  Harmony syncs data every 24 hours by default. Trigger a manual sync anytime from **Settings → Integrations → Google Workspace → Sync Now**.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

### Automated User Lifecycle

- **Onboarding**: Auto-create Google Workspace accounts for new hires
- **Provisioning**: Assign appropriate licenses based on department/role
- **Offboarding**: Suspend accounts and transfer data when employees leave
- **Role Changes**: Update groups and access automatically when roles change

### License Optimization

- **Identify unused licenses**: Track users who haven't logged in recently
- **Right-size plans**: Identify users with expensive licenses who don't use features
- **Forecast needs**: Predict license requirements based on hiring plans
- **Cost allocation**: Track license costs by department

### Access Management

- **Group-based access**: Automate group memberships based on attributes
- **Temporary access**: Grant time-limited access to resources
- **Access reviews**: Periodic audits of group memberships and permissions
- **Compliance**: Enforce security policies like 2-Step Verification

## Troubleshooting

### Connection fails during authorization

**Possible causes:**
- Not signed in as Super Admin
- API access not enabled
- OAuth consent screen not configured

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're using a Super Admin account
2. Verify API access is enabled in Admin console
3. Check OAuth settings in Google Cloud Console

### User sync is incomplete

**Possible causes:**
- Large organization (sync in progress)
- Missing API scopes
- Suspended users not included

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 30-60 minutes for initial sync to complete
2. Verify all required scopes are authorized
3. Check if you want to include suspended users in sync settings

### Cannot provision new users

**Possible causes:**
- Missing admin privileges
- Domain-wide delegation not configured
- No available licenses

**Solutions:**
1. Verify domain-wide delegation is set up
2. Check that required scopes are authorized
3. Ensure available licenses exist for the user type
