2. **Blueprint Mapping**: Map Kandji blueprints to Harmony roles/departments
3. **Compliance Monitoring**: Enable automatic compliance tracking
4. **Remote Actions**: Enable Harmony to execute device commands
5. **Auto-Assignment**: Configure automatic blueprint assignment rules

### Step 4: Set Up Automation Rules

Configure intelligent workflows:

1. **New Hire Provisioning**:
   - Trigger: New employee in HRIS
   - Action: Assign device to appropriate blueprint
   - Notify: Send setup instructions via Slack
2. **Compliance Alerts**:
   - Trigger: Device falls out of compliance
   - Action: Notify user and IT team
   - Remediate: Apply fixes automatically when possible
3. **App Deployment**:

## Use Cases

### Automated Onboarding

Zero-touch deployment for new employees:

1. New employee record created in HRIS
2. Harmony detects new hire in Engineering
3. Device assigned to "Developer Blueprint" in Kandji
4. Employee receives Mac via mail
5. Device auto-enrolls via Apple Business Manager
6. All apps and settings configured automatically
7. User receives welcome message with setup guide

### Compliance Monitoring

Proactive security management:

```
Scenario: MacBook falls out of compliance
1. Kandji reports FileVault not enabled
2. Harmony detects compliance violation
3. Sends Slack message to user:
   "Your Mac needs FileVault encryption enabled for security"
4. Provides step-by-step enablement guide
5. Monitors until compliance restored
6. Logs resolution in ticket system
```

### Software Requests

Self-service app deployment:

- User: "I need Figma installed"
- Harmony AI:
  1. Verifies Figma is in Kandji library
  2. Checks user's blueprint permissions
  3. Initiates deployment via Kandji
  4. Monitors installation progress
  5. Confirms with user when complete

### Device Troubleshooting

Intelligent endpoint support:

- User: "My Mac is running slowly"
- Harmony queries Kandji for device health
- Identifies issues (low storage, outdated OS)
- Recommends cleanup and updates
- Guides user through resolution
- Verifies performance improvement

### Offboarding Automation

Secure device management during exits:

1. Employee offboarding initiated in HRIS
2. Harmony retrieves employee's devices from Kandji
3. Applies "Offboarding" tag to devices
4. Sends notification to manager for device retrieval
5. After confirmation, executes remote lock
6. Schedules full erase after data backup
7. Removes device from Kandji after completion

## Troubleshooting

### Devices Not Appearing

**Issue**: Devices enrolled in Kandji don't show up in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API token has "Devices: Read" permission
- Check that API token hasn't been revoked or expired
- Ensure devices are fully enrolled (not pending)
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Verify Kandji tenant URL is correct

### Blueprint Assignment Failed

**Issue**: Unable to assign device to blueprint

**Solutions**:
- Confirm API token has "Blueprints: Write" permission
- Verify blueprint exists and is active in Kandji
- Check that device is in a state that allows blueprint changes
- Ensure device isn't locked or erasing
- Review Kandji audit logs for error details

### Remote Commands Not Executing

**Issue**: Lock, erase, or restart commands fail

**Solutions**:
- Verify device is online and checked in recently
- Confirm API token has "Devices: Write" permission
- Check device hasn't already been erased or retired
- Ensure device supports the requested command
- Review command queue in Kandji portal

### Compliance Data Outdated

**Issue**: Compliance status not current

**Solutions**:
- Kandji devices report status on check-in (varies by device state)
- Force device to check in via Kandji portal or device
- Adjust sync frequency in Harmony settings
- Verify device has network connectivity
- Check Kandji service status
