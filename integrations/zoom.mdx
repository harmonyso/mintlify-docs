- Last login date and activity
- Meeting host statistics

### Meetings

- Scheduled meetings and webinars
- Meeting history and attendance
- Recording information
- Meeting duration and frequency

### Usage Analytics

- Daily/weekly/monthly active users
- Meeting minutes consumed
- Average meeting duration
- Peak usage times and patterns
- Adoption metrics by department

## Use Cases

### License Optimization

Harmony automatically identifies cost-saving opportunities:

- **Unused Licenses**: Users with licenses who haven't hosted meetings in 30+ days
- **Downgrade Candidates**: Licensed users who only attend (don't host) meetings
- **Upgrade Candidates**: Basic users who frequently need to host meetings
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Identify licenses that can be temporarily removed during low-usage periods

**Estimated Savings**: Organizations typically save 15-30% on Zoom costs within the first quarter.

### Automated Provisioning

Streamline user onboarding with automated workflows:

1. **New Hire Onboarding**: Automatically assign Zoom licenses based on department or role
2. **Offboarding**: Remove licenses when users leave the organization
3. **License Reallocation**: Reclaim licenses from inactive users and reassign to active users
4. **Role-Based Assignment**: Auto-assign Pro vs. Basic licenses based on job function

### Usage Insights

Understand collaboration patterns to make data-driven decisions:

- Identify departments with high/low Zoom adoption
- Track meeting trends over time
- Analyze Zoom Rooms utilization to optimize conference room investments
- Measure impact of remote work policies on meeting frequency

### Compliance & Governance

Maintain audit trails and enforce policies:

- Generate reports on meeting history for compliance audits
- Track recording storage and retention
- Monitor external participant access
- Enforce meeting security settings organization-wide

## Troubleshooting

### Connection fails with "Invalid credentials"

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect Account ID, Client ID, or Client Secret
- App not activated in Zoom Marketplace
- Credentials expired or revoked

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you copied the credentials exactly without extra spaces
2. Ensure the app status is **Activated** in Zoom App Marketplace
3. Regenerate Client Secret if unsure about its validity
4. Confirm you're using Server-to-Server OAuth (not OAuth or JWT)

### User sync is incomplete

**Possible causes:**
- Missing `user:read:admin` scope
- Users are pending activation in Zoom
- API rate limits being hit

**Solutions:**
1. Verify all required scopes are granted to the app
2. Check that users are fully activated in Zoom admin portal
3. For large organizations (5,000+ users), contact Harmony support to enable incremental sync

### Cannot assign licenses to users

**Possible causes:**
- Missing `user:write:admin` scope
- No available licenses to assign
- User is not eligible for the license type

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `user:write:admin` scope is granted
2. Verify you have unassigned licenses available in Zoom
3. Check that user meets requirements for the license type (e.g., email domain)

### Usage data not updating

**Possible causes:**
- Missing `report:read:admin` or `dashboard:read:admin` scopes
- Zoom's API reporting delay (up to 24 hours)
- Account doesn't have Business or Enterprise plan

**Solutions:**
1. Verify reporting scopes are granted
2. Wait 24-48 hours after first connection for initial data
3. Confirm your Zoom account has access to reporting APIs (Business+ plan)
