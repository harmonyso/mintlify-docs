   - Preserve: Capture forensic data
3. **Policy Violations**:
   - Trigger: Agent policy violation
   - Action: Enforce policy, update agent
   - Notify: Alert IT team if persistent
4. **Agent Health Monitoring**:
   - Trigger: Agent goes offline or out-of-date
   - Action: Attempt remote update
   - Escalate: Notify user if action needed
5. Click **Save Configuration** and **Enable Integration**

## Use Cases

### Autonomous Threat Response

Fully automated malware remediation:

```
Scenario: Malware Execution Detected
1. SentinelOne detects malicious process
2. Automatically kills process and quarantines file
3. Rolls back malicious changes to system
4. Harmony notifies user: "We detected and removed malware from your device"
5. Creates ticket documenting the incident
6. No user action required
```

### Ransomware Protection

Rapid response to ransomware attacks:

1. SentinelOne detects ransomware behavior
2. Immediately isolates device from network
3. Kills ransomware process
4. Rolls back file encryption
5. Harmony alerts security team with critical priority
6. Provides forensic timeline of attack
7. Documents incident for security review
8. Restores network access after verification

### Agent Health Management

Proactive endpoint protection monitoring:

- Monitor agent health across all endpoints
- Detect agents that go offline or out-of-date
- Automatically attempt to update agents
- Notify users if manual action required
- Track agent deployment and coverage
- Escalate persistent issues to IT team

### Threat Hunting

AI-assisted threat investigation:

- Security analyst queries for specific IOCs
- Harmony searches SentinelOne Deep Visibility data
- Identifies affected endpoints
- Provides timeline of relevant events
- Suggests containment and remediation actions
- Documents findings in investigation tickets

### False Positive Management

Streamline handling of benign detections:

- User reports legitimate software blocked
- Harmony reviews threat details from SentinelOne
- AI suggests if likely false positive based on context
- Security team approves with one click
- Marks as benign, adds exclusion if needed
- Restores user access immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Threats Not Syncing

**Issue**: Threats detected in SentinelOne don't appear in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API token has "Threats: View" permission
- Check severity threshold settings in Harmony
- Ensure API token hasn't expired
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Review SentinelOne activity log for API access

### Isolation Commands Failing

**Issue**: Unable to isolate/reconnect devices

**Solutions**:
- Confirm API token has "Agents: Disconnect from network" permission
- Verify agent is online and active
- Check that device isn't already in requested state
- Ensure agent version supports network isolation
- Review SentinelOne logs for error details

### Agent Status Outdated

**Issue**: Agent health status not current in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Agents report status based on heartbeat interval
- Trigger manual sync to refresh data
- Verify agent has network connectivity
- Check SentinelOne console for agent status
- Adjust sync frequency in Harmony settings

### Remediation Actions Not Executing

**Issue**: Rollback or mitigation actions fail

**Solutions**:
- Verify API token has "Threats: Mitigate" permission
- Check that threat is in a state that allows remediation
- Ensure agent supports requested action
- Review threat classification (some threats can't be rolled back)
- Check SentinelOne activity log for errors

## Best Practices

### Threat Response

- **Autonomous First**: Let SentinelOne's AI handle standard threats automatically
- **Escalation Rules**: Define clear escalation criteria for human intervention
- **Response Playbooks**: Document procedures for different threat types
- **Regular Testing**: Test response automation with simulated threats
- **Tuning**: Adjust sensitivity based on false positive rates

### Agent Management

- **Update Strategy**: Keep agents current with staged rollout approach
- **Coverage Monitoring**: Track agent deployment across all endpoints
- **Health Checks**: Monitor agent health metrics and act on degradation
- **Policy Alignment**: Ensure policies match organizational risk tolerance
- **Offline Handling**: Define procedures for persistently offline agents

### User Communication

- **Transparent Messaging**: Inform users when threats are detected and remediated
- **Education**: Use incidents to teach security awareness
- **Minimal Disruption**: Automate responses to minimize user impact
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific guidance when user action needed
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback on security experiences

### Security Operations

- **Threat Intelligence**: Regularly review threat trends and patterns
- **Incident Reviews**: Conduct post-mortems for significant incidents
- **Performance Metrics**: Track MTTD (Mean Time To Detect) and MTTR (Mean Time To Respond)
- **Continuous Improvement**: Refine automation based on lessons learned
- **Integration Health**: Monitor API usage and integration performance

## Data & Privacy

### Data Handling

- Security telemetry encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)
