## Prerequisites

Before connecting BambooHR to Harmony, ensure you have:

1. **BambooHR Administrator access**
2. **Permissions to generate API keys**
3. **Your BambooHR subdomain** (e.g., `company.bamboohr.com`)
4. **A Harmony account** with admin privileges

<Note>
  Only BambooHR administrators can generate API keys required for the integration.
</Note>

***

## BambooHR Configuration

### Step 1: Generate API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    1. Log in to your BambooHR account
    2. Click your profile icon in the top-right corner
    3. Select **API Keys** from the dropdown menu
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New API Key">

    3. Click **Generate Key**
    4. **Important**: Copy the API key immediately—it won't be shown again

    <Warning>
      Save the API key securely. If lost, you'll need to generate a new key and update your Harmony configuration.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Access Levels (Optional)

BambooHR API keys have the same permissions as your user account. If you want to limit access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Dedicated API User">
    1. Navigate to **Settings → Employees**
    2. Add a new employee record for the API integration
    3. Set **Access Level** appropriately
    4. Generate an API key for this user
  </Step>
</Steps>

    2. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Configuration">

    | -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
    | **Subdomain**  | Your BambooHR subdomain (without .bamboohr.com) | `company`                      |
    | **API Key**    | The API key generated in BambooHR      | `abc123def456ghi789jkl...`     |

    <Note>
      Enter only your subdomain, not the full URL. For example, if your BambooHR is at `company.bamboohr.com`, enter just `company`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Connection">
    1. Click **Connect**
    2. Harmony will test the connection by fetching basic company information
    3. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message

## What Harmony Syncs from BambooHR

Once connected, Harmony automatically syncs:

### Employee Data

- Employee profiles (name, email, phone)
- Job information (title, department, division)
- Employment status (active, terminated, on leave)
- Start and end dates
- Manager relationships
- Work location and address
- Emergency contact information

### Organizational Structure

- Departments and divisions
- Reporting hierarchy
- Office locations
- Cost centers

### Employment Events

- New hire notifications
- Termination notices
- Job changes and transfers
- Status changes (full-time, part-time, contractor)

<Tip>
  Harmony syncs data in real-time when webhooks are configured, or every 4 hours by default. Critical events like new hires and terminations trigger immediate sync.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Connection fails with "Invalid API key"

**Possible causes:**
- API key entered incorrectly
- API key has been revoked
- Wrong subdomain specified

**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key was copied correctly without extra spaces
2. Generate a new API key in BambooHR
3. Confirm subdomain matches your BambooHR URL

### Employee sync is incomplete

**Possible causes:**
- Employee records missing required fields (email)
- Employees marked as archived in BambooHR
- API rate limits being hit

**Solutions:**
1. Check that all employees have valid email addresses
2. Verify sync includes archived employees if needed
3. For large organizations (1,000+ employees), contact support

### Workflows not triggering automatically

**Possible causes:**
- Webhooks not configured
- Workflow trigger conditions not met
- Workflow disabled

**Solutions:**
1. Configure webhooks in BambooHR for real-time updates
2. Check workflow trigger conditions match event data
3. Verify workflow is enabled in Harmony
