## Prerequisites

Before configuring the Monday integration, ensure you have:

- **Monday Admin Access**: Board admin or account admin role
- **Monday Subscription**: Standard plan or higher (for API access)
- **API Token**: Generated from Monday account settings
- **Harmony Account**: Active Harmony workspace with integration permissions
- **Monday Boards**: Boards created for IT projects/tasks

## Configuration in Monday

### Step 1: Generate API Token

1. Log in to Monday at `https://[your-account].monday.com`
2. Click your profile photo in the bottom left
3. Select **Admin** > **API**
4. Click **Generate API Token** (or copy existing token)
5. Configure token:
   - **Name**: "Harmony Integration"
   - **Scope**: Full access (or custom scope with boards:read and boards:write)
6. Click **Generate**
7. **Copy the API token immediately**

<Note>
API tokens have access to all boards visible to the generating user. Consider using a dedicated service account.
</Note>

### Step 2: Set Up IT Boards

Create boards for IT operations:

1. **IT Projects Board**: Track major IT initiatives
   - Columns: Status, Priority, Assigned To, Due Date, Progress
2. **IT Tasks Board**: Day-to-day IT operations
   - Columns: Request Type, Status, Urgency, Owner, Resolution Time
3. **IT Hardware Board**: Track hardware procurement
   - Columns: Device Type, Status, Employee, Order Date, Delivery

### Step 3: Configure Board Templates

Create templates for common IT workflows:

1. Go to board settings
2. Click **Save as template**
3. Create templates:
   - New Employee Onboarding
   - Software Deployment
   - Hardware Refresh
   - Security Incident Response
4. These templates can be instantiated automatically by Harmony

## Configuration in Harmony

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log in to your Harmony dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
3. Find **Monday** and click **Connect**

### Step 2: Enter API Credentials

Provide the following information:

- **API Token**: The token you generated
- **Account Slug**: Your Monday account slug (from URL)

Click **Verify Connection**

### Step 3: Configure Board Mapping

1. Harmony will discover all accessible Monday boards
2. Select which boards to integrate:
   - ☑️ IT Projects
   - ☑️ IT Tasks
   - ☑️ IT Hardware Requests
   - ☐ HR Onboarding (different team)
3. Map ticket types to Monday boards:
   - Hardware Request → IT Hardware Board
   - Project Request → IT Projects Board
   - General Support → IT Tasks Board
4. Map status columns:
   - Harmony "New" → Monday "To Do"
   - Harmony "In Progress" → Monday "Working on It"
   - Harmony "Resolved" → Monday "Done"

### Step 4: Set Up Automation Rules

Configure intelligent workflows:

1. **Ticket to Task Creation**:
   - Trigger: High-priority ticket created in Harmony
   - Action: Create Monday task in IT Tasks board
   - Assign: Map to appropriate team member
   - Link: Maintain bidirectional link
2. **Project Initiation**:
   - Trigger: Project-type request approved
   - Action: Create Monday board from template
   - Populate: Fill in requester and requirements
   - Notify: Alert project team
3. **Status Synchronization**:
   - Trigger: Task status changes in either platform
   - Action: Update status in the other platform
   - Notify: Alert assignee if needed
4. **Deadline Alerts**:
   - Trigger: Monday task approaching due date
   - Action: Send reminder via Slack
   - Escalate: Alert manager if overdue
5. Click **Save Configuration** and **Enable Integration**

## What Harmony Syncs

### From Monday to Harmony

- **Boards**: Board names, IDs, and structure
- **Items**: All items (tasks) from mapped boards
- **Columns**: Column definitions and values
- **Status**: Item status and progress
- **Assignees**: Person column assignments
- **Due Dates**: Timeline and deadline information
- **Updates**: Item updates and comments
- **Sub-items**: Nested tasks and subtasks
- **Files**: Attached documents and files

### From Harmony to Monday

## Use Cases

### IT Project Tracking

Centralize IT project management:

1. IT receives request for new software deployment
2. Harmony creates Monday board from template
3. Board includes:
   - Requirements gathering tasks
   - Infrastructure setup tasks
   - Testing and QA tasks
   - Deployment and rollout tasks
4. Each task linked to related Harmony tickets
5. Project progress visible in both systems
6. Stakeholders updated via Monday dashboards

### Hardware Procurement Workflow

Streamline device ordering:

```
User: "I need a new laptop"
Harmony:
1. Creates ticket for hardware request
2. Creates Monday item in IT Hardware board
3. Assigns to procurement team
4. Tracks status:
   - "Pending Approval" (manager approval)
   - "Ordered" (procurement)
   - "In Transit" (logistics)
   - "Ready for Pickup" (IT team)
   - "Delivered" (user confirmed)
5. Updates user at each status change
6. Logs completion in both systems
```

### Sprint Planning Integration

Align IT support with sprint cycles:

- IT team uses 2-week sprints in Monday
- Harmony tickets automatically added to current sprint board
- Team capacity visible in Monday
- Harmony routes tickets based on Monday workload
- Sprint burndown tracked in both systems
- Retrospective data combined from both sources

### Incident Management

Coordinate major incident response:

1. Critical system outage detected
2. Harmony creates high-priority incident ticket
3. Automatically creates Monday board for incident:
   - Investigation tasks
   - Communication tasks
   - Fix implementation tasks
   - Post-mortem tasks
4. War room team assigned in Monday
5. Status updates synchronized to Harmony
6. Users informed via Harmony/Slack
7. Incident timeline documented in Monday
8. Post-mortem report generated from both systems

### Resource Allocation

Balance IT team workload:

- Monday tracks all IT projects and capacity
- Harmony routes new tickets based on Monday workload
- AI avoids assigning to overloaded team members
- Managers view capacity dashboard
- Forecasts resource needs based on trends
- Identifies bottlenecks and rebalances work

## Troubleshooting

### Items Not Creating

**Issue**: Harmony tickets don't create Monday items

**Solutions**:
- Verify API token has write permissions (boards:write)
- Check board mapping configuration
- Ensure board isn't archived or deleted
- Verify column mappings are correct
- Review Harmony logs for API errors

### Status Not Syncing

**Issue**: Status changes don't sync between platforms

**Solutions**:
- Verify status column mapping is correct
- Check that status values match exactly
- Ensure API token has update permissions
- Review webhook configuration
- Trigger manual sync to refresh

### Permission Errors

**Issue**: "Forbidden" or "Access Denied" errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify API token hasn't expired or been revoked
- Check user/service account has access to boards
- Ensure boards aren't private/restricted
- Regenerate API token if needed
- Verify Monday account permissions

### Duplicate Items

**Issue**: Same task appears multiple times

**Solutions**:
- Check for multiple automation rules triggering
- Verify unique identifier mapping
- Review webhook configuration for duplicates
- Disable and re-enable integration if needed

## Best Practices

### Board Organization

- **Clear Structure**: Use consistent board structures across IT
- **Column Standards**: Standardize column names and types
- **Status Values**: Use same status names across boards
- **Templates**: Create templates for repeatable workflows
- **Archival**: Archive completed boards regularly

### Workflow Efficiency

- **Selective Sync**: Only sync boards relevant to IT operations
- **Automation Rules**: Use Monday's native automations in addition to Harmony
- **Notifications**: Configure notifications to avoid alert fatigue
- **Batch Updates**: Group similar tasks for efficiency
- **Regular Reviews**: Review workflows monthly for optimization

### Team Collaboration

- **Visibility**: Make IT boards visible to stakeholders
- **Updates**: Use Monday updates for communication
- **@Mentions**: Tag relevant people in updates
- **Dashboards**: Create Monday dashboards for IT metrics
- **Training**: Ensure team knows how to use Monday effectively

### Performance

- **API Rate Limits**: Monday has API rate limits (complexity-based)
- **Efficient Queries**: Request only necessary data
- **Webhooks**: Use webhooks for real-time updates when available
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
- **Batch Operations**: Batch API calls when possible
