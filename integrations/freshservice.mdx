   - **Email**: `harmony-integration@yourcompany.com`
   - **Agent Type**: Administrator or custom role with API access
4. Click **Create Agent**
5. Log in as this service account to generate its API key

### Step 3: Configure Ticket Fields

Prepare ticket fields for synchronization:

1. Go to **Admin** > **Ticket Fields**
2. Create custom fields for Harmony sync:
   - **Harmony Ticket ID**: Text field
   - **Harmony Status**: Dropdown (Synced, Pending, AI Resolved)
   - **AI Resolution**: Checkbox (to mark AI-resolved tickets)
3. Click **Save** for each field

### Step 4: Set Up Webhook (Optional)

For real-time ticket updates:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Workflow Automator**
2. Create new automation:
   - **Trigger**: Ticket is created/updated
   - **Action**: Trigger webhook
   - **Webhook URL**: Provided by Harmony (e.g., `https://api.harmony.io/webhooks/freshservice`)
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Content**: Include ticket JSON payload
3. Click **Save**

## Configuration in Harmony

### Step 1: Navigate to Integrations

1. Log in to your Harmony dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**

### Step 2: Enter API Credentials

Provide the following information:

- **Freshservice Domain**: Your domain (e.g., `company.freshservice.com`)
- **API Key**: The key you generated
- **Email**: Email address associated with the API key

Click **Verify Connection**

### Step 3: Configure Ticket Sync

1. **Sync Direction**: Choose:
   - Bidirectional (recommended for full integration)
   - Freshservice → Harmony (import tickets for AI resolution)
   - Harmony → Freshservice (maintain Freshservice records)
2. **Status Mapping**: Map ticket statuses between systems:
   - Freshservice "Open" → Harmony "New"
   - Freshservice "Pending" → Harmony "In Progress"
   - Freshservice "Resolved" → Harmony "Resolved"
   - Freshservice "Closed" → Harmony "Closed"
3. **Priority Mapping**: Align priority levels
4. **Ticket Types**: Select which ticket types to sync (Incident, Service Request, Problem, Change)
5. **Field Mapping**: Map custom fields between systems

### Step 4: Configure Knowledge Base

1. **Enable KB Search**: Allow Harmony AI to search Freshservice solutions
2. **Solution Categories**: Select which categories to include
3. **Article Freshness**: Set minimum last-updated date (e.g., articles from last 2 years)
4. **Search Priority**: Set priority level for Freshservice articles vs. other knowledge sources
5. **Auto-Linking**: Enable automatic linking of relevant articles to tickets

### Step 5: Set Up Automation Rules

Configure intelligent workflows:

1. **AI-Powered Ticket Resolution**:
   - Trigger: New incident ticket in Freshservice
   - Condition: Ticket category is "Password Reset" or "Access Request"
   - Action: Sync to Harmony, attempt AI resolution
   - Update: Mark as resolved in Freshservice if successful
2. **Knowledge Article Search**:
   - Trigger: User asks question in Slack/Teams
   - Action: Search Freshservice solutions
   - Response: Provide answer with link to article
   - Create: Create ticket if no solution found
3. **SLA Escalation**:
   - Trigger: Ticket approaching SLA breach
   - Action: Escalate to human agent
   - Notify: Alert support team via Slack
4. **Asset Sync**:
   - Trigger: Device provisioned in Harmony
   - Action: Create or update CI in Freshservice CMDB
5. Click **Save Configuration** and **Enable Integration**

## Use Cases

### Migrating to Autonomous IT

Gradual transition from traditional ITSM:

1. Enable bidirectional sync to maintain Freshservice records
2. Route specific ticket categories to Harmony for AI resolution (e.g., password resets)
3. Monitor resolution success rates
4. Gradually expand AI-resolved categories
5. Maintain Freshservice for compliance and reporting
6. Eventually phase out Freshservice as confidence grows

### Hybrid Support Model

Best-of-both-worlds approach:

- **Freshservice**: External customer support, compliance tickets, change management
- **Harmony**: Internal IT support, autonomous resolution, employee self-service
- **Sync**: Maintain visibility across both platforms

### Knowledge Base Enhancement

Leverage existing Freshservice content:

- User asks question via Slack
- Harmony searches Freshservice solution articles
- Provides answer with link to original article
- Tracks which articles are most useful
- Suggests updates for outdated articles

### Service Catalog Fulfillment

Automate service requests:

- User submits service request in Freshservice portal
- Request syncs to Harmony
- Harmony fulfills request automatically (provisions access, deploys software)
- Updates Freshservice ticket with completion status
- User notified of completion

### Asset and CMDB Sync

Maintain configuration management database:

- Harmony provisions new laptop
- Creates CI in Freshservice CMDB
- Updates relationships (user, software, peripherals)
- Tracks device lifecycle in both systems
- Syncs hardware changes and updates

## Troubleshooting

### Tickets Not Syncing

**Issue**: Tickets created in Freshservice don't appear in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify API key is valid and hasn't been revoked
- Check sync filters and ticket type selection
- Review status mapping configuration
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Verify network connectivity and API rate limits

### Authentication Failures

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key" errors

**Solutions**:
- Verify API key copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check that service account hasn't been deactivated
- Ensure account has sufficient permissions
- Regenerate API key if needed
- Verify Freshservice domain is correct

### Duplicate Tickets

**Issue**: Same ticket appears multiple times

**Solutions**:
- Check custom field mapping for unique identifiers
- Verify webhook configuration isn't sending duplicate events
- Review sync direction settings
- Disable and re-enable integration if necessary

### Knowledge Articles Not Found

**Issue**: AI can't find Freshservice solutions

**Solutions**:
- Verify articles are published (not drafts)
- Check solution category filters in Harmony
- Ensure articles meet freshness criteria
- Confirm API key has access to knowledge base
- Review article content for searchable text

## Best Practices

### Ticket Management

- **Clear Status Mapping**: Ensure statuses mean the same thing in both systems
- **Consistent Priorities**: Align priority definitions across platforms
- **Field Consistency**: Use same terminology and values
- **SLA Preservation**: Configure Harmony SLAs to match or exceed Freshservice

### Knowledge Base

- **Regular Updates**: Keep articles current with latest procedures
- **Clear Writing**: Write articles for AI and human readability
- **Rich Content**: Include screenshots and step-by-step guides
- **Categorization**: Properly categorize for better AI retrieval
- **Analytics**: Track article usage to identify gaps

### Performance Optimization

- **Selective Sync**: Only sync tickets that require dual visibility
- **Webhook Usage**: Use webhooks for real-time updates
- **Batch Processing**: Schedule bulk operations during off-hours
- **Archive Strategy**: Archive old tickets to reduce overhead
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Freshservice API rate limits

### Migration Strategy

- **Phased Approach**: Migrate ticket types gradually
- **Pilot Program**: Start with one department or ticket type
- **Success Metrics**: Define clear KPIs (resolution time, satisfaction, etc.)
- **Training**: Educate support team on hybrid model
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert if needed
