## Use Cases

### Automated New Hire Provisioning

Complete IT setup triggered by HR:

1. HR adds new employee to Bob with start date next Monday
2. Harmony detects new employee in Engineering department
3. One week before start date:
   - Orders MacBook Pro (based on role)
   - Creates email account in Google Workspace
   - Sets up Okta account with temp password
   - Adds to GitHub Engineering team
   - Assigns to Slack channels
   - Adds to relevant security groups

   - Ships laptop to employee's address
   - Sends welcome email with setup instructions
5. On start date:
   - Sends Slack welcome message
   - Assigns IT onboarding buddy
   - Creates checklist ticket for IT setup verification

### Role-Based Access Provisioning

Automatic access adjustment for role changes:

```
Scenario: Employee Promotion
1. HR updates employee in Bob: "Software Engineer" → "Senior Engineer"
2. Harmony detects role change
3. Reviews current access:
   - Has: Write access to app repositories
   - Has: Standard AWS permissions
4. Grants additional access:
   - Adds: Admin access to team repositories
   - Adds: Elevated AWS permissions
   - Adds: Production environment access
5. Notifies employee and manager of access changes
6. Documents change in audit log
```

### Department-Based Request Routing

Intelligent ticket routing using org data:

- Employee from Sales department submits ticket
- Harmony checks Bob for department and location
- Routes to appropriate IT support team
- Includes context: manager name, office location, start date
- Prioritizes based on role (executive = higher priority)

### Seamless Offboarding

Complete access removal based on HR termination:

1. HR marks employee as terminated in Bob (last day: Friday)
2. Harmony creates offboarding checklist:
   - ☐ Retrieve laptop and peripherals
   - ☐ Disable all accounts
   - ☐ Transfer files and emails
   - ☐ Remove from all security groups
   - ☐ Cancel software licenses
3. On termination date:
   - Disables Okta account (cascades to all apps)
   - Schedules email archive for 30 days
   - Removes from Slack workspace
   - Revokes VPN access
   - Locks laptop remotely
4. Generates comprehensive offboarding report for manager

### Manager Hierarchy for Approvals

Use org structure for approval workflows:

- Employee requests elevated access
- Harmony checks Bob for manager
- Routes approval request to direct manager
- If denied, can escalate to manager's manager
- Maintains audit trail of approval chain

## Troubleshooting

### Employees Not Syncing

**Issue**: New employees in Bob don't appear in Harmony

**Solutions**:
- Verify service user has "People: Read" permission
- Check employee status is included in sync filter
- Ensure employee has required fields populated (email, name)
- Trigger manual sync from Harmony dashboard
- Review Bob API status and rate limits

### Onboarding Workflows Not Triggering

**Issue**: New hire automation doesn't activate

**Solutions**:
