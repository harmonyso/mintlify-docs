## IT Service Desk

Harmony transforms traditional IT support into an autonomous, AI-powered experience. Employees submit requests through any channel, and Harmony's AI handles each intelligently:

- **Autonomous Resolution** — AI resolves common requests instantly without human intervention
- **Smart Routing** — Tickets are automatically classified and assigned to the right teams
- **Knowledge-Powered** — Answers questions with accurate, sourced information from your knowledge base
- **Seamless Escalation** — Hands off to human agents with full context when needed

## Base URL

Each organization has its own subdomain. Replace `<customer_subdomain>` with your organization's subdomain:

```
https://<customer_subdomain>.harmony.io
```

<Tip>
Example: If your organization is Acme Corp with subdomain `acme`, your API base URL is `https://acme.harmony.io`
</Tip>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens:

```bash
curl -X GET https://<customer_subdomain>.harmony.io/api/v1/tickets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

To obtain an API token:
1. Log into your Harmony dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
3. Click **Generate New API Key**
4. Copy the token (it will only be shown once)

<Warning>
Keep your API tokens secure. Never commit them to source control or share them publicly.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited to ensure service stability:

| Limit Type | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Per Hour | 1,000 requests |
| Per Minute | 100 requests |

Rate limit information is included in response headers:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit` — Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining` — Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` — Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure:

**Success Response (200-299)**
```json
{
  "id": "ticket-123",
  "title": "Reset password request",
  "status": "open",
  "priority": "high",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Error Response (400-599)**
```json
{
  "detail": "Ticket not found"
}
```
