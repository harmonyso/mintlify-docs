## Customize Your Dashboard

Transform your Harmony dashboard into a personalized command center by adding, editing, and arranging widgets to visualize the data that matters most to your team. This guide walks you through everything you need to know about dashboard widget management.

<Info>
  **Before you begin:** Ensure you have edit permissions for the dashboard you want to customize. System dashboards are read-only and cannot be modified.

## Accessing Your Dashboards

### Navigate Between Dashboards

Harmony provides multiple pre-configured dashboards, or you can create custom ones:

![Navigate to Dashboard](https://static.guidde.com/v0/qg%2F7fNmMWG8v0Po8TJfgMOcCAT7yVC2%2Fm4cWemKZJ6jb5VhKDY1Cwy%2FhxsBX4aaW2PX2usqaEizxJ_doc.png?alt=media&token=25eda512-f0de-4ee5-9076-ac9098b25c80)

**Available Dashboards:**
- **System Dashboard** — Overview of all IT operations
- **Assets Dashboard** — Hardware and software inventory metrics
- **Service Desk Dashboard** — Ticket and support metrics
- **AI Performance Dashboard** — Automation insights

Click the dashboard dropdown menu to switch between views.

### Filter by Time Range

Adjust the time range to focus on the data period that matters most:

![Select Time Range](https://static.guidde.com/v0/qg%2F7fNmMWG8v0Po8TJfgMOcCAT7yVC2%2Fm4cWemKZJ6jb5VhKDY1Cwy%2F7XTtpKcWEsMu48fF3uYCkg_doc.png?alt=media&token=74a26da2-4c71-4421-9e5f-e445bef87015)

**Available Time Ranges:**
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days

<Tip>
  The dashboard automatically adjusts data granularity based on your selected time range for optimal readability.
</Tip>

## Adding Widgets to Your Dashboard

You can add widgets to your dashboard in two ways: **View Mode** (quick add with auto-save) or **Edit Mode** (full customization with manual save).

### Method 1: Quick Add in View Mode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add widgets'">
    From any dashboard, click the **Add widgets** button in the top-right corner.
    
    ![Add Widgets Button](https://static.guidde.com/v0/qg%2F7fNmMWG8v0Po8TJfgMOcCAT7yVC2%2Fm4cWemKZJ6jb5VhKDY1Cwy%2Fjxm88Z2uA67kZxoYg9fRes_doc.png?alt=media&token=0af9165f-9f82-4ae0-9b53-c5737718c5f0)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browse the Widget Library">
    The widget library opens, displaying all available widgets organized by category:
    - **Number Widgets** — Single metric displays (tickets, SLA %, response times)
    - **Chart Widgets** — Visual data (trends, breakdowns, comparisons)
    
    ![Widget Library](https://static.guidde.com/v0/qg%2F7fNmMWG8v0Po8TJfgMOcCAT7yVC2%2Fm4cWemKZJ6jb5VhKDY1Cwy%2FuFXFADvanqzyijh6gcMYN7_doc.png?alt=media&token=eda58e38-e55f-4f8b-b673-8b305d4e482a)
    
    <Tip>
      Hover over any widget to see a preview of how it will look with your data.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Widget">
    Click on any widget to add it to your dashboard. The widget is automatically added and saved to your layout.
    
    ![Select Widget](https://static.guidde.com/v0/qg%2F7fNmMWG8v0Po8TJfgMOcCAT7yVC2%2Fm4cWemKZJ6jb5VhKDY1Cwy%2FbmRKqGT86ypqeH6noZDQut_doc.png?alt=media&token=884d90d5-4155-4bc0-a575-4638a31ae2d5)

### Method 2: Full Customization in Edit Mode

For more control over widget placement and sizing, use Edit Mode:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Edit Mode">
    Click the **Edit** button to enable full dashboard customization.
    
    ![Enter Edit Mode](https://static.guidde.com/v0/qg%2F7fNmMWG8v0Po8TJfgMOcCAT7yVC2%2Fm4cWemKZJ6jb5VhKDY1Cwy%2FgFAnmx8H8kV8oMuxDWRwbD_doc.png?alt=media&token=297373f4-ea24-4ccc-9038-00e8e28999f9)
    
    Once in edit mode, you'll see additional controls on each widget.
  </Step>

    Click **Add widgets** and select from the library. Widgets are added to your layout but not saved until you click **Save & Exit**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Arrange Your Layout">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Dashboard Permissions

    The System Dashboard is managed by Harmony and cannot be edited. It provides a standardized view of your IT operations.
    
    <Note>
      The Edit and Add Widgets buttons are disabled on system dashboards.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Custom Dashboards (Editable)">
    Custom dashboards can be fully customized by users with appropriate permissions:
    - Add/remove widgets
    - Rearrange layout
    - Resize widgets
    - Rename dashboard
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Creating Role-Based Dashboards

Design specialized dashboards for different teams:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Leadership Dashboard">
    High-level KPIs for executives:
    - SLA compliance %
    - User satisfaction score

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Widget Management Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="lightbulb" title="Start Simple">
    Begin with 4-6 essential widgets that answer your most critical questions. You can always add more as your needs evolve.
    
    **Recommended starter widgets:**
    - Total Tickets (number)
    - SLA Compliance % (number)
    - Opened vs Resolved Tickets (line chart)
    - Ticket Breakdown by Status (donut)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="layout" title="Organize by Priority">
    Use the grid layout strategically:
    - **Top row:** Number widgets for at-a-glance KPIs
    - **Middle rows:** Trend charts for pattern analysis
    - **Bottom rows:** Detailed breakdown charts
    
    Number widgets automatically fill the top row from left to right.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="expand" title="Size Widgets Appropriately">
    Adjust widget sizes based on importance and complexity:
    - **Small (3-4 columns):** Number widgets, simple metrics
    - **Medium (6 columns):** Single trend lines, simple breakdowns
    - **Large (9-12 columns):** Complex charts, multi-series data
    
    <Tip>
      Larger charts are easier to read but take up more screen space. Find the right balance for your workflow.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clone" title="Use Edit Mode for Bulk Changes">
    When making multiple layout changes:
    1. Enter Edit Mode once
    2. Add multiple widgets
    3. Arrange and resize as needed
    4. Save all changes together
    
    This is more efficient than using Quick Add for each widget individually.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="users" title="Create Role-Specific Dashboards">
    Don't try to build one dashboard for everyone. Create targeted views:
    - Executives: High-level KPIs only
    - Managers: Mix of KPIs and trend analysis
    - Operators: Detailed breakdowns and current status
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Understand Color Coding">
    Widgets use consistent colors across Harmony:
    - **Green:** Positive metrics (resolved, compliant, on-time)
    - **Red:** Issues requiring attention (SLA breached, non-compliant)
    - **Orange:** Warnings or in-progress states
    - **Blue:** Neutral data and information
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="ban" title="Why can't I edit the System Dashboard?">
    The System Dashboard is a read-only, pre-configured view managed by Harmony. To customize your layout:
    1. Create a new custom dashboard
    2. Add the widgets you need
    3. Arrange them to match your workflow
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="floppy-disk" title="My changes disappeared after refresh">
    Make sure you clicked **Save & Exit** when in Edit Mode. Changes are not saved automatically in Edit Mode.
    
    In View Mode, widgets added via "Add widgets" are auto-saved immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-simple" title="Widget shows 'No data available'">
    This usually means:
    - No data exists for the selected time range
    - The integration providing data is not configured
    - You don't have permissions to view the data
    
    Try adjusting your time range or contact your administrator.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="arrows-spin" title="Widget won't resize to the size I want">
    Widgets have size constraints:
    - Number widgets: 3-12 columns wide, fixed height
    - Chart widgets: 3-12 columns wide, 3-9 rows tall
    
    The grid snaps to these increments to maintain visual consistency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Tips

<Tip>
  **Quick Add Shortcut:** In View Mode, clicking "Add widgets" and selecting a widget instantly adds it to your dashboard with automatic positioning.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Widget Preview:** Hover over any widget in the library to see a preview with your actual data before adding it.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Bulk Layout Changes:** Use Edit Mode when making multiple changes at once — add several widgets, arrange them all, then save once.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Time Range Affects All Widgets:** The dashboard-level time range filter applies to all widgets simultaneously, making it easy to compare metrics across the same period.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Unsaved Changes Warning:** Don't worry about losing work — Harmony warns you if you try to navigate away with unsaved changes in Edit Mode.
